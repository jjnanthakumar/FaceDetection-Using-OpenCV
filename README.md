"# FaceDetection-Using-OpenCV" 
Here I have used OOPS concepts for reusing code.
So you can also import this module in any python file after cloning or downloading the required files.
haarcascade files are necessary for this module.
Then import it in any python file and the downloaded file 'facedetect.py', requires files must be in the same directory.
Otherwise you can't import this module.
